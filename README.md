Spych (pronounced "speech") — a lightweight, fully offline Python speech-to-text toolkit for wake word detection, audio transcription and AI integrations. Built on [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) and [PvRecorder](https://github.com/Picovoice/pvrecorder).

- Fully offline -> no API keys, no cloud calls, no internet required
- Multi-threaded wake word detection that rarely misses a trigger between recording windows
- Multiple wake words, each mapped to a different action
- Built-in agents for 
    - [Ollama](https://ollama.com) 
    - [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)

# Setup

Make sure you have Python 3.11.x (or higher) installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

```
pip install spych
```

## Quick Start: Voice Agents

The fastest way to get started is via `spych.agents`. These one-liners handle everything — wake word detection, transcription, and passing your speech to the target agent.

### Ollama

Requires [Ollama](https://ollama.com) to be installed and running locally. 
For this example, pull the model first with `ollama pull llama3.2:latest`.

```python
from spych.agents import ollama

# Say "llama" or "ollama" to trigger
# Hint: I find saying "Hey Llama" works better than just "Llama" or "Ollama"
ollama(model="llama3.2:latest")
```

### Claude Code CLI

Requires [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) to be installed in your **terminal** and authenticated.
- Verify with `claude --version` in your terminal.
- Fun side hint, you can run claude code with ollama if you want a fully offline experience.

```python
from spych.agents import claude_code_cli

# Say "claude" to trigger
# Hint: I find saying "Hey Claude" works better than just "Claude"
claude_code_cli()
```

Both agents support a `terminate_words` list (default: `["terminate"]`) — saying a terminate word will stop the listener cleanly.

| Parameter | `ollama` default | `claude_code_cli` default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wake_words` | `["llama", "ollama"]` | `["claude"]` | Words that trigger the agent |
| `terminate_words` | `["terminate"]` | `["terminate"]` | Words that stop the listener |
| `model` | `"llama3.2:latest"` | — | Ollama model name |
| `listen_duration` | `5` | `5` | Seconds to listen for after wake word |
| `continue_conversation` | — | `True` | Whether to reuse the most recent session in Claude CLI |
| `history_length` | `10` | — | Number of past interactions to include in the prompt sent to Ollama |
| `host` | `"http://localhost:11434"` | — | URL of the Ollama instance to connect to |
| `spych_kwargs` | — | — | Additional keyword arguments to pass to the Spych constructor |
| `spych_wake_kwargs` | — | — | Additional keyword arguments to pass to the SpychWake constructor |

### Want a different agent?
No problem! You can build your own custom agent by subclassing `BaseResponder` and passing an instance to `SpychWake`. See the API reference below for details.

# Wake Word Detection + Transcription

If you want more control, use `SpychWake` and `Spych` directly.

## Listen and Transcribe

`Spych` records from the microphone and returns a transcription string.

```python
from spych import Spych

spych_object = Spych(
    whisper_model="base.en", # We default to the english-only base.en, but all faster-whisper models are supported (tiny, base, small, medium, large)
    whisper_device="cpu",  # or "cuda" for faster performance if you have an Nvidia GPU with CUDA support
)

transcription = spych_object.listen(duration=5)
print(transcription)
```
See: https://connor-makowski.github.io/spych/spych/core.html


## Wake Word Detection

`SpychWake` listens continuously for one or more wake words and fires a callback when detected.

```python
from spych import SpychWake, Spych

spych_object = Spych(whisper_model="base.en", whisper_device="cpu")

def on_wake():
    print("Wake word heard! Listening for 5 seconds...")
    print(spych_object.listen(duration=5))

wake_object = SpychWake(
    wake_word_map={"speech": on_wake},
    whisper_model="tiny.en",
    whisper_device="cpu", # or "cuda" for faster performance if you have an Nvidia GPU with CUDA support
)

wake_object.start()
```
See: https://connor-makowski.github.io/spych/spych/wake.html

## Multiple Wake Words

Map different wake words to different callbacks in a single listener.

```python
from spych import SpychWake, Spych
from spych.agents import OllamaResponder, LocalClaudeCodeCLIResponder

spych_object = Spych(whisper_model="base.en", whisper_device="cpu")
wake_object = SpychWake(
    wake_word_map={
        "llama": OllamaResponder(spych_object, model="llama3.2:latest"),
        "claude": LocalClaudeCodeCLIResponder(spych_object),
    },
    whisper_model="tiny.en",
    terminate_words=["terminate"]
)
wake_object.start()
```

## Responders

Responders need additional explanations. Responders handle the listen-transcribe-respond cycle and are callable, making them suitable as `wake_word_map` values. All responders inherit from `BaseResponder`.

### `BaseResponder`

Subclass this to build a custom integration. Only `respond` needs to be implemented.

```python
from spych.responders import BaseResponder

class MyResponder(BaseResponder):
    def respond(self, user_input: str) -> str:
        # Your custom logic here
        # For exmample, you may pass this to an API, run some code, or trigger a local action
        return "response"
```

A full implementation that uses `test` as a wake word would look like:

```python
from spych.responders import BaseResponder
from spych import Spych, SpychWake

class MyResponder(BaseResponder):
    # A custom init function to set up any necessary variables or connections for your responder
    def __init__(self, spych_object, name="Custom Responder"):
        super().__init__(spych_object, name=name)
    
    def respond(self, user_input: str) -> str:
        # Your custom logic here
        return f"I am a custom responder named '{self.name}' and I heard: {user_input}"

wake_object = SpychWake(
    wake_word_map={"test": MyResponder(Spych(whisper_model="base.en"))},
    whisper_model="tiny.en",
    terminate_words=["terminate"]
)

print("Starting wake listener. Say 'test' to trigger the MyResponder function.")
wake_object.start()
```
